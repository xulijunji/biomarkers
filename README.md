# Combiom: an algorithm to search for combinatorial biomarkers

## Implementation and usage

The algorithm to search for combinatorial biomarkers is incorporated in `Combiom. searching for combinatorial biomarkers.ipynb` notebook and available as a separate `combiom.py` file. An example of data analysis is available in `Combiom. Statistical analysis, cross validation and plotting.ipynb`.

Combiom can be imported by:
```python
import combiom
```

## Results

Resulting [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrames are stored as *pickle* files. Excel files were created with Pandas and [XlsxWriter](http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/). See Jupyter notebooks for details.
